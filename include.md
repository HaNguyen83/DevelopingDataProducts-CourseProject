Welcome to storm database analysis

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database collected between 1950 - 2011 to determine which tracked weather events cause the highest number of injuries and fatalities, then which weather events cause the most expensive damage.

This application help users explore the dataset by adjusting year range and event types on the left side:
- Tab "By Impact category": display the Population Impact (aggregate the number of fatalities and injuries) or Economic impact (aggregate the damage value for properties and crops) by state.
- Tab "By Event Type": display the Population Impact (aggregate the number of fatalities and injuries) or Economic impact (aggregate the damage value for properties and crops) by event type so that users can recognise which is the most dangerous event.
